Introduction
============
Razi provides extensions to SQLAlchemy to work with chemical databases. Currently, development is mainly focused on the functionalities provided by the `RDKit <http://rdkit.org>`_ extension for the PostgreSQL database, but support for additional database backends is in the plans.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Source code is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/rvianello/razi>`_. Either clone the repository or download a source package, change into the razi directory and type the following command (since the project is still in its earlier development phases, you may want to use a virtualenv)::

    $ python setup.py install
